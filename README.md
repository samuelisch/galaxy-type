# galaxy-type
Pure Javascript, HTML and CSS game based on HTML Canvas

## Access and deployment
This game can be accessed through [Github Pages](https://samuelisch.github.io/galaxy-type/)

### Motivation
I wanted to create a game where users are able to practice their keyboard navigational skills. Inspired by a touch-typing game's implementation, I wanted to create another game implementation for users to familiarize themselves with their computer keyboards.

### Features
The game is built on top of a HTML Canvas element, and the menus and other elements are placed on top of the canvas container.

The game includes a leaderboard implementation, tracking and saving the user scores, stored in localStorage. The leaderboard will only consist of the local computer's score history.

### Future implementations
I will implement a database for the application to fetch from and save to. This ensures that users are able to see other users' scores, and compare their own scores globally.
